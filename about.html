        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Tegan Watson. I'm a recent grad and front end web developer focusing on building beautiful, responsive websites.</p>
        <h3>Further Education in Programming</h3>
        <p>I discovered my interest in programming when I took an HTML/CSS class in college,
          and decided to continue learning to code on my own time, in addition to my formal academic studies.
          I have completed the <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/web-designer/">web design</a> course at Skillcrush,
          and have worked up through the front end classes in <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101">The Odin Project.</a>
          To fully cement my understanding of front end development before moving forward, I am currently working on completing the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development">Front End Web Development track</a> at Treehouse.</p>
          <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>When I'm not writing code, I like to write other things.
        I majored in film and media studies and minored in creative writing, and so have pursued various styles of writing,
      from <a href="http://fardotgo.blogspot.com/2016/02/on-such-small-campus-you-shouldnt-have.html">op ed pieces</a> and <a href="http://fardotgo.blogspot.com/2016/04/wells-colleges-oldest-cappella-group.html">press releases</a>
      to screenwriting, novel writing, short fiction, and poetry, some of which I post on my writing blog, <a href="http://aprilwednesday.wordpress.com">A Teacup Full of Wine.</a>
      I worked for three years as Senior Fiction Editor for my campus literary magazine, the Wells Chronicle, and became Co-Editor-in-Chief in my junior year.
      My poetry has been published in <a href="http://themissingslate.com/2013/01/11/a-ribcage-drenched-in-dust/">The Missing Slate</a>, <a href="http://www.youblisher.com/p/920453-parenthetical-issue-one-may-2014/">(parenthetical)</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.everest-magazine.com/fall2015.html#page/1">Everest</a>.</p>
